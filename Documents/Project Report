# Project Report IDATA2304 2022
This IoT Project is a school project made by four computer engineer students in the course IDATA2304 Computer networks.

### Abstract
Due to the worlds situation the electricity prices in Europe, including Norway has increased drastically the last year.
However, it is difficult to know where we are using using electricity, how much we are using and what it costs. By
tracking your Kwh usage and the electricity price in your area this application provides the information needed to
better control electricity usage.


### Introduction

- Our solution are planned to work in every home. We have planned the project to be implemented in every home with a simple sensor, and connect it with our website.
- The problem our project surround is related to energy consumption. The tremendous increase in electricity prices and the lack of electricity in the world makes this a quite relevant problem. The program takes mesurements inside houses to log the energy consumption. This data will be analysed and used in order to present different savings schemes for energy to the user. Our diagrams or schemes will help induviduals save money and electricity, and help companies to optimize their usage of energy.
- The program resolve around a kWh sensor which log the usage of kw. **Need further writing...**
