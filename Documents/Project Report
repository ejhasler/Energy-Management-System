This IoT Project is a school project made by four computer science students in the course IDATA2304 Computer networks.

### Abstract

Due to the worlds situation the electricity prices in Europe, including Norway has increased drastically the last year.
However, it is difficult to know where we are using using electricity, how much we are using and what it costs. By
tracking your Kwh usage and the electricity price in your area this application provides the information needed to
better control electricity usage.


### Introduction

The problem we are planning to solve is related to energy consumption. Our solution is planned to be easily implemented in every home or construction that wants to have better control over their energy consumption. The tremendous rise in electricity prices in Norway and the global energy crisis makes a solution wich helps with decreasing the energy consumption is both relevant to the energy crisis on a global level and for induviduals which take a big burden due to the high electricity prices.
